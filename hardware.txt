Hardware key can provide you better protection and shorter password
Using this instruction, you can easily create it:
1. Launch "hardware.py"
2. Select drive for key creation. Warning: all data will be lost. It may take a while. If you need, select reserve drive.
3. When your key will be created and encrypted, read your password
4. When you will need to use that key, input "HARDWARE <drive letter> <password>". For example, if after insertion drive received the letter "D" and password is AbCdEf, input HARDWARE D AbCdEf.

Recomendations:
1. Be careful, without disk there is no way you can restore passwords 
2. Bigger disk will be safer, but it may slow down working with it
3. For correct work with your hardware key, it's recommended to have more than 1 GB of free RAM and more free drive space, then on your hardware key. Example: if 32 GB USB-flash device is used as key, you should have at least 32 GB of free drive space on disk C
